## THIS IS A SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON A LARGE DATASET OF AMAZON REVIEW.CSV FILE.  TO DO SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS ON ANY FILE YOU FIRST HAVE TO PREPROCESS THE DATA MEANING CLEAN THE DATA, TRANSFORM THE DATA, APPLY SOME EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS ON THEM. YOU CAN VISUALIZE THE DATA TOO. SENTIMENTAL ANALYSIS TELLS WHETHER THE DATA IS HAVING A POSITIVE EFFECT OR A NEGATIVE EFFECT.
